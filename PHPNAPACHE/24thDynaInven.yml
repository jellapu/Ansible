Ansible Dynamic Inventory:
 Our inventory is really dynamic then only we use this process

Ansible Parallelism:
 Ansible establishes parallel connection with node which is called as fork.
By default ansible uses 5 forks
We can set the default number of forks in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file

ansible-playbook -i hosts play.yml -f 100
ansible -f 1 -m ping all
